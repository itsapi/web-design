PropView
--------

Definition:

 - The users of my system are individuals who have an account with PropView. The customers will post information about their properties to the website and I am told that the customers are generally not tech-savvy so the interface must be simple and easy to use. The person I am making the site for, Joe Van Auken, will also be a user as he will set up the accounts for the customers.

 - The company I am making the website for is called PropView. The owner (who is my contact) wants to set up the PropView web service to allow individuals to post information about properties they own on the site. He does not currently have any system in place and would like me to build the system.

 - PropView will be a website which allows customers to buy an account through Joe Van Auken and then post properties they own for people to see. They will be able to post information, photos and maps. The number of things they can post depends on the package they buy. Another part of the website will allow Joe to create accounts once customers have requested them. The site will also have a section for people to view properties and contact the owner.
