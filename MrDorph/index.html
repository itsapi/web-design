				<h2>New Recruits</h2>
				<p>All new recruits please note that teamspeak is a clan requirement, those that do not use it while playing platoon games and tank companies will he removed from our clan. Teamspeak is a very useful tool for winning matches and also to get to know the team! You will also benefit from advice from people who have been playing this game for a long time. Please download and install Teamspeak as you read this.</p>

				<h2>Teamspeak Information</h2>
				<p>Our Teamspeak server is private. You will not find us on the public community list, so please do not put the address into the search box.</p>

				<p>Click connections > connect > Server Address and type in ukts.vortexservers.com:10024</p>
				
				<p>You must obtain the teamspeak password from one of our clan officers before you try to connect, please ask on-line. Also please make sure your nickname matches your world of tanks name so people will not get confused.</p>

				<h2>Tank Companies</h2>
				<p>Tank: company battles started officially on Wednesday 15th May for the English Armored Brigade, and despite coming up against hard and well organized teams, we are finally getting the right tanks and tactics, it has been a steep learning curve but i and a few commanders feel that success will not be too far off. This success to Tank companies is absolutely essential to laying the foundations for Clan Wars. So please can all members and new recruits check out our Battle Schedule link: at the top of the page, and make sure you turn up on the night for the team!</p>

				<h2>Clan Wars</h2>
				<p>EAB will enter Clan wars when we have at least 20 members with tier 9 and above tanks. By then we will have the experience from tank companies to help us, but with our much larger tanks! So i ask people to keep grinding the tech trees and advancing up the tiers. My current estimate for clan wars is October/November. But i will keep everyone updated.</p>
