	<h3>Teamspeak</h3>
	<p>
		Firstly, our Teamspeak server has been created for the use of EAB members, it's for our clan to use for the use of improving platoon games and for us all to gather in the lobby and talk about <b>WOT</b> and to get to know each other. Those who shy away from Teamspeak and don't get involved will have no future. Teamspeak will be our key to tactics on the battlefield in clan matches and clan wars, so please lets all get to know each other and use it to our advantage when going out in platoon games and training! Talking to each other is also key to learning from one another and discussing tanks and tech tree routes, we all have different knowledge of tanks and tech tree routes so lets share them.
	</p>

	<h3>Battle Tactics And Structure</h3>
	<p>
		Just let me explain our structure in our proposed clan battles (tank companies), Having discussed this with our Field commanders we have come up with a basic battle proposal. Every match will consist of platoons. Every platoon will have a field commander made up with a soldier and / or recruit. The field commander of every platoon will take responsibility of each platoon and make immediate decisions, however at the beginning of every match every platoon will be assigned a general order and task, this order will be issued by the acting commander in charge of that match! All communication on Teamspeak will take place between the acting Commander and Field commanders to keep communication clearer and to a minimum.
	</p>

	<h3>Early Battles</h3>
	<p>
		In these early stages of tank companies we have found that only a certain number of tanks win matches on a regular basis. Firstly, the only tier 6 heavy which dominates the match is the KV1S. The only tank which is a valuable support tank is the Hellcat, and The fastest tier 4 scout is the T50. Tier 4 artillery is whichever a player wishes to use. These tanks are the best line-up for winning tank companies, and we will have to apply a system to suite when we go up to the next tank company level. So please can all players keep those tanks in their garage for assisting the team in Tank companies.
	</p>

	<h3>Tanks</h3>
	<p>
		So from what you can see you can get a good idea of what tanks you may need to be looking at as we progress, however we do understand that others will want to play with tank destroyers and light tanks here and there in Platoon games, this is fine, at the end of the day nobody can stop you heading for tanks for your own personal agenda, Platoon games are for fun and to get used to playing with each other.
	</p>

	<h3>Training</h3>
	<p>
		Before we organise a tank company battle, we will be heading into the training room for a quick recap on the system and get used to gathering into our correct platoons, and also for receiving orders etc. Also training matches will be organised every now and again to improve our game play.
	</p>

	<h3>Clan Wars!</h3>
	<p>
		A quick section about clan wars. We should consider entering clan wars when we have at least 20 members (but more will be ideal) who have tier 8 and above tanks (tier 9 and 10 are really essential to winning battles). So I would probably estimate that with the regular people we have gaming at the moment, and knowing what tanks we have, I would put a date on October to Christmas time before we have the men and tanks to attack a province on the clan wars map! This might seem a long way away but we have to look at it intelligently. It's the numbers of regular players with high tier tanks that we need! So those of you with 5s and 6s you need to get cracking if you want to be on the front line!
	</p>

	<h3>Premium Account</h3>
	<p>
		Just a short note to people who don't have a premium account, I know its 9 quid a month but if you can manage it every now and again I highly recommend it, Its much quicker up the tech tree! But I do understand if you can't manage it!
	</p>

	<h3>Promotions</h3>
	<p>
		Promotions will happen regularly to people who use Teamspeak and put 100 percent into platoon games. However, to become a field commander you must show real skill and leadership in the game, being able to make the right decisions for your platoon, and even being able to bark out orders. Myself and the other commanders do check how people play and we are constantly looking for the players who show these abilities! So if you think you can become a field commander, then show us.
	</p>

	<h3>Info</h3>
	<p>
		Information will posted on this website, either on the forum or in the schedule battle section (calendar) so please check regularly for updates.
