### MrDorph - IN PROGRESS
#### http://dvbris.no-ip.org/webDesign/MrDorph

C:
> hey, just inquiring about the webdesign offer you put up, what exactly can 
> you do?
>
> www.eab-wot.moonfruit.com This our current website that was thrown together 
> in about 5 minutes. Its a gaming clan website, we'd like something that 
> looks a bit more professional.

M:
> I can do HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX. Do you want to keep the same sort of 
> style or something completely different?

C:
> We have a list of pages we want but we want it to be a bit more secure, so
> we'd want an open welcome page but require a log in to access any other part
> of the site and a decent forum page. http://worldoftanks.eu/ that's the game
> to give you an idea of style. Can you do logo design?

M:
> You could use phpbb3 for the forum, do you want the login just for the
> forum, or other things as well? I'll be happy to help design the site and
> set up the forum if you want?

C:
> Yeah, I'm out at the moment so can't give proper details, what sort of
> information will you need?

C:
> Home. So I have no knowledge of web design what so ever, so the phpbb3 thing
> means nothing to me, so whatever you think is best or easiest is fine. If i 
> were to draw basic layouts (i mean really crude drawings this really isn't
> my strong point) and what not would you be able to follow that?
>
> What we'd want is for the main page to be accessible to all but the rest of
> the website a log in requirement. Certain things we'd want to be able to
> change, like the main banner, because we have yet to get a logo designed,
> and the ability to add new pages. I don't know how feasible any of this is.

M:
> phpbb3 ( https://www.phpbb.com/ ) is a prebuild open source forum package
> that is really easy to set up, it's what most forums use. Linking the forum
> login with the rest of the site's login might be a problem, but you could
> restrict access to the forums to users logged in on the rest of the site, so
> you would have to create a seperate account for the forum.
>
> If you give me layouts and some color scheame ideas that would be fine to 
> get me started, then we can go from there. Changing parts and adding pages
> shouldn't be a problem.

C:
> Ok, sounds good. I like a black and orange design of sorts, anything tanky
> if that makes sense, just not that standard camo look. Can you do any logo
> designs or is it just web design? I will discuss the layout but I'm thinking
> something along these lines http://i.imgur.com/VM5Jggj.png?1 , again
> apologies for the crudeness of this, we do have a photos section but its
> just a page of photos, is it possible to have like a player of sorts?

M:
> I'm not that strong on logos, you'd probably be better off going to someone
> else for that, the layout looks good. The photos page should be fine, by
> player, do you mean a player account page?

C:
> something like what msn has http://uk.msn.com/, so it has that thing at the
> top the "player" to select stories, but something similar for photos.
> http://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/slideshow/#screenshot/579763
> thats the closest thing I could find to what I mean.
>
> I'm also thinking of having a rusty texture for the background.

M:
> Oh, player as in gallery? Sorry, I thought you ment a player like a player
> in a game. Yes I could do something like that easily :)

C:
> yes a gallery, the word escaped me. I will let you know if there's anything
> specific that we want anywhere or if there is anything you can think of that
> you think would look neat or be good, then please let us know.

M:
> OK, I'll start working on a layout and some basic styling tonight then :)

M:
> So I've got most of the layout done:
> http://dvbris.no-ip.org/webDesign/MrDorph How do you like this so far? I
> havn't done any text styling yet, but the layout is there, and its fairly
> responsive. Do you have any suggestions, things I've done wrong? What were
> you planning on putting in the sidebar, adds or more information? I was
> thinking we could put the login form in there if you had no other plans. The
> background gives it a sort of rust look, I found this collection:
> http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/handy-roundup-of-free-seamless-repeating-textures
> are there any you think would work better / want me to try?

C:
> It looks great, We'll be tweaking what goes on that home page, none of the
> links work is that right? other than that i've put it out to a few of the
> other members and i'll let you know. Can you get rid of the side bar? what I
> would want is either side of the center section is a long picture, if you
> get what i mean, like the one on the world of tanks website (
> worldoftanks.eu )
>
> Other than that I like the background you selected, Hopefully we'll be able
> to sort out a proper EAB heading. Could you make the Links at the top a
> solid colour? Orange with black writing and could you make them rounder?

M:
> Cool :) Correct, the links are dud. I just copied the old text so I could
> have somethink to work on.
>
> Ok, I understand what you mean about the side bar, that can be done and I'll
> sort out the links. Do you have any ideas about fonts?
> ( http://google.com/fonts ) is a good place to find free ones. What do you
> want in the header at the top of the page? A banner image with your logo, or
> heading?

C:
> I'll discuss the phont with the team, hopefully we'll have a proper logo
> sorted soon to put at the top. I'll also have a look for a picture to put
> wither side. Where it say copyright at the bottom, feel free to put designed
> by and then your information.

M:
> Ok, updated with temp stolen worldoftanks background image, is that what you
> were after? Also updated links, what do you think of the orange color, do
> you want me to change the shade?

C:
> That looks great, really like it, I'll try and get the font sorted out with
> someone and a proper welcome message for you to put on the home page, but so
> far I'm really impressed. Thanks

M:
> Awesome :) Glad you like it.
>
> I'm going away without proper internet for the next few days, I'll be back
> on tuesday, so we'll start sorting out the forum and stuff then.

C:
> I've been asked to ask you about the possibility of adding advertising for
> help for heroes and the royal British legion to all the pages, somewhere in
> the footer, they're UK charities for troops, do you know if there's a
> protocol to it?

M:
> I don't know if there are any protocols, but I imagine you could just link
> to their donate page in the footer. You might what to contact them to ask
> them if they have any particular way of doing it.

C:
> I will leave it until its closer to being finished, there were a few other
> things I was asked to mention but I will leave it for now, time for bed.

C:
> Hey, any update on the website?

M:
> Do you have any plans for hosting/domain name, if you are planning using a
> free host I recommend 000webhost.com I have used them multiple times and
> they are good for a free host. If you are using another host, make sure they
> have php installed as we will need that for phpbb3.
>
> Also do you have any update on the logo or background image?

C:
> Hello. We will be in purchasing a .co.uk domain, I think it will be
> WWW.englisharmouredbrigade.co.UK, not too sure or EAB.co.UK, something along
> those lines. Do you know how we would go about putting the website up? We
> would like to keep the background image as is, would there be any copyright
> problems with this? I will link you the logo when I finish it, we're just
> using a basic logo designer so it wont be to fancy.

M:
> To put the website up you will need a host, you can usually get free hosting
> when you purchice a domain name, just make sure you find one with php and
> mysql, ask me if you need help finding one.
>
> There would definatly be problems with using the world of tanks image, as it
> is theirs. We could try to find a similar image but copyright free, you
> could also try taking an ingame screenshot, I don't mind doing some light
> editing to put some screenshots together.
>
> Do you have any update on the font?

C:
> Hello, I have messaged wargaming regarding the use of their images and
> hopefully they will get back to me soon. Would the host you recommended be
> suitable for all the stuff we will need? I will let you pick the font, there
> are far too many, Something bold and easy to read.
>
> Update to the layout Ideas, for the tabs at the top we would like home to
> become welcome, photos to become gallery, downloads and contacts to be moved
> to the end, with contacts right at the end, and info to become announcements
> or news what ever looks better.
>
> so it will be, Welcome, about, news, gallery, forum, downloads, contact.
>
> How do we go about setting up admins once the site is finished? With the
> gallery will we be able to set one up for videos? Embedding the youtube
> player or something like that? I am working till 11 tonight so won't be bale
> to get back to you till then, hopefully I will have been sent the welcome
> page message by then and will be able to send it to you.

M:
> You could use any site to buy the domain, this is a good one:
>
> http://123reg.co.uk
>
> For hosting, this is a free uk host which does everything you need:
>
> http://www.getfreehosting.co.uk
>
> I've edited the navigation bar.
>
> For the admins, I'll create a basic admin page for editing the pages with a
> password to get in (so to add a admin, you just give them the password), but
> you can always come back and ask me if you want anything done.
>
> The gallery can do youtube, videos, anything... even other websites if you
> really want!

C:
> It will be just to update the images and news section, and to upload images
> and videos as well. What do you mean by other websites? This threw me a bit.
>
> Out of interest do you game at all?

M:
> That should all work.
>
> I just meant you could have a frame where another website could be displayed
> like an image. You probably wont need to use this though.
>
> No I don't really game, I used to a bit, but It meant I ran out of time for
> other things.

C:
> This looks pretty much like what I have now, but yep, that is, though
> unfinished, looking fine.

M:
> Opps, didnt update the online version, navigation should be right now.

### coderqi - IN PROGRESS
#### http://olls.no-ip.org/webDesign/coderqi/index.html

C:
> Hi Olls96,
> 
> I've built my own website, doing the full stack, but need a designer to
> come in and sort out the frontend.
> 
> You can have a look at the site here: autobean.co.uk. We crawl second hand
> car listings, and aggregate them to allow search in one place.
> 
> I'm looking for a clean, clear, modern design, but haven't really managed to
> do it myself.
> 
> Currently i'm using jade templates with angular.js and bootstrap, but am
> really unhappy with the look, though I feel like the basic building blocks
> are there.
> 
> If you could with the mobile version (maybe just by using the responsive
> features of bootstrap, maybe not), that would also be great.
> 
> If you can help, please let me know.
> 
> Cheers,

M:
> I'll be happy to help you design the website, I can do responsive stuff if
> you need. Do you want to keep the curent layout, or completly redesign it?

C:
> I don't mind particular either way. If you think you have some interesting
> ideas for a complete re-design, i'm open to them :). If however you want to
> help polish it up (and maybe focus on making it work on the phone), i'm also
> ok with that.
>
> I guess my single provision if you do want to do a complete redesign is that
> it should remain fairly clean, but i'm certainly open to any ideas you have.

M:
> I think the layout is fine, so we can stick with that. I'm fine to get it
> working on the phone, do you want to keep the phone fairly similar to what
> you've got as well?

C:
> I think on the phone, the results page should just show the adds, and if the
> user wants to refine their search, there should be someway of bringing up a
> menu screen where they can add or remove refinements to their search.

C:
> P.S But yes, the results part doesn't need to be too different between the
> mobile and desktop/ipad versions.

M:
> Ok. Do you have any websites that sort of match the style you're going for,
> so I don't get completly the wrong end of the stick? :D

C:
> Indeed.co.uk is what I was trying to go for... I like their colour scheme,
> and relatively clean professional look
>
> Otherwise websites in the same field tend to have horrible background
> colours. I'm trying to keep it clean/minimal with a white background, but as
> I said, i'm open to expert advice :)
>
> Some sites i'm crawling, which i'm trying to avoid looking like: 
> gumtree.co.uk (horrible background colour) carsite.co.uk (better than
> gumtree, but I guess I hate the green) autotrader.co.uk (not too bad)

M:
> Ok, I'll have a play around with what you've got and see what I can do :)

C:
> No worries. Cheers!

M:
> I've looked through the code on your website and it looks like it may be
> hard to do anything to change much of the styling easily, without having to
> significantly rewrite the HTML. Which, from my perspective, looks like it's
> embedded deeply into the webapp, which would make it near impossible to 
> change anything without rebuilding the site from scratch. Unless you think
> there is a way to rewrite the HTML easily, I'm not sure there's much I can
> do to help.
>
> Sorry that I couldn't help you much.

C:
> Erghh, if you're talking about seeing the html, you can just ctrl/command-a
> to select all, right click and do "view selection source."
> (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7957549/how-can-i-see-javascript-rendered-source).
> You'll get the html on a few lines, but you can easily prettify it. You can
> then play with it to your hearts content...
>
> Let me know if you need more help with this. I can just create some google
> docs containing the html and share them with you?
>
> If you just want to supply me with some static html pages, that's fine
> (And what i expected :) ). I can then partition it and convert it into the
> jade format i use.
>
> Does this help?

M:
> Yes, thank you. I was aware of the javascript source, I just wasn't sure how
> feasible it would be to switch your HTML, I think it would require almost a
> full rewrite of the HTML, because honestly, it's a mess! I'll try to keep
> most of the structure the same, but simplify it, if you're sure you can
> integrate it back in to the code.

C:
> P.S the command I gave you in my previous message works in firefox.
>
> Also, i've got some draft logos back. You can check them out here:
> http://imgur.com/euU1A15
>
> I'm thinking of going for the third image, though asking for a colour change
> from the brown to a colour i'm using on the site.
>
> Your input would be great; at least if you have an idea of what colour
> scheme your are using, that is if you are thinking of using something

M:
> I was planning on keeping the colour scheme mostly the same as you've
> already got, but maybe introduce some darker colors to give it some more
> depth, the brown in the logo would fit quite nicely, maybe a slightly darker
> shade in the website.
>
> I'm going to be away for the next few days with no PC, so nothing will get

C:
> Hi,

> So how's the redesign going?

> Simon

M:
> This is what I've got so far just for the home page:
> http://dvbris.no-ip.org/webDesign/coderqi/
> It's not done yet obviously, and I'm just using the logo you sent me, but
> what do you think of the style? Is it what you were going for or have I got

M:
> I've done the browse and search pages now too:

### Edge_Sharp - IN PROGRESS
#### http://dvbris.no-ip.org/webDesign/Edge_Sharp/

C:
> olls96, are you offering to help design a website? If so, I would really
> appreciate any assistance you could offer.
>
> Let me know, Thanks,

M:
> Yes, I'll help you, what do you need?

C:
> I really could use any advise or help you would be willing to provide. I am
> in the process of starting up a company that helps small and med sized
> business increase their onsite (at their office) banking security. I have
> designed the system (product) and was just beging to test it with small
> business in my area (about 5), when I happend to discuss my idea with one of
> my local banks. As it turns out, they loved the idea and want me to come in
> and present my product to their director. While I have the product, I dont
> have any online presence of a company yet, so I am trying to get something,
> anything up that makes this look half way legitimate. To give you a little
> background about my self, I am a product developer and sales man by trade,
> but I unfortunately know very little about website design. So with all that
> said, do you think you could help me get something very basic setup? I am
> more than happy to write or provide whatever would be needed (text for
> pages, website requirements, etc...), I just need someone who can tell me/
> show me what to do.
>
> So what do you think?

M:
> I'm happy to help you set something up, what sort of pages were you planning
> on having?

C:
> My initial idea was to keep it as simple as possible, but still have it look
> professional. I was thinking that it would probably follow the standard
> 'Home, Product, Blog, Contact' template/design. If at all possible, it would
> be great to have a section where a potential customer could request more
> info. But I think for now, this is all I would need. What are your thoughts?

M:
> That's all fine. The contact form should be easily doable as well. Do you
> have any idea about the style, or layout of the website, or some example
> websites that sort of match what your after looks-wise?

C:
> Sorry about not getting back to you right away, I have been tied up for a
> few days. With regards to your question, I keep coming back to these 3
> designs.
> http://www.aeris.com/ http://www.angleseyonline.com/
> http://www.esourcemarketing.com/ I like the simplicity of their sites, and I
> think it would fit the needs of my service. Since the product is a secure
> banking system, it is not really 'flashy', so I don't believe it will
> warrant a lot of pictures. 

M:
> Ok, those designs all seem fairly simple, so I'll get build a mockup, then
> we can go from there.

M:
> One more thing, what sort of color scheame do you want/have, do you have a
> logo for me to base things off?

C:
> For now I am calling the business 'Secure Banking Transaction Solutions', or
> SBTS for short. I think the name will change, but for now it is something to
> use. As for a logo, I have not designed one yet. However, I could submit it
> to r/freedesign and see what they come up with. With regards to colors, in
> an effort to keep it simple, I was thinking ; black, blue and white. I have
> a feeling that should this idea take off, we will have to do a complete
> re-brand of the company... but that can come later.

M:
> http://dvbris.no-ip.org/webDesign/Edge_Sharp/
>
> Ok, this is what I've got so far. I haven't done much on the colours yet,
> but the layout and text styling is there. I didn't no whether you wanted the
> banner/slider, but you can decide. Tell me what you think of the fonts and 
> anything you want changing.

### KnashDavis - IN PROGRESS

C:
> Can you do Wordpress design? My site is hosted using Wordpress software on
> our own servers
>
> Thanks, Knash

M:
> Yes, I can.
> Do you want me to work off an existing style or compleatly from scratch?

C:
> It would likely be from scratch.
>
> Our site is at www.mygeekreview.com
>
> I don't like the theme currently and am looking for a geeky/nerdy/techy kind
> of theme.
>
> I can try and do a design brief if you want.

M:
> Hello, sorry for taking a while to get back to you, I've been busy with
> other reddit website requests!
>
> We have some time to do your website now.
>
> A design brief won't be necessary, if you just give us an idea of the
> layout, colour scheme, or any other websites look similar to what you want,
> that will be enough to get going, then we can change things from there.

C:
> Well we're running a geek culture news website. Our color scheme is blue and
> white currently. We're on Wordpress can you do that?

C:
> Oh whoops. I think you said you could. Sorry early morning here. xD

M:
> How much of the styling do you need doing? Is it just the main layout, or

C:
> Ok thats what I'm looking. And phpbb will be just fine.

> I really want to thank you in advance :D

M:
> Ok, I think I get you. I'll be able to start work on it around wednesday,
> could you draw a rough mockup of how you want the page to be laid out for
> me, then I should be able to get it done fairly quickly.

C:
> What do you want me exactly to draw? I don't really get you but if you want
