C:
> hey, just inquiring about the webdesign offer you put up, what exactly can 
> you do?
>
> www.eab-wot.moonfruit.com This our current website that was thrown together 
> in about 5 minutes. Its a gaming clan website, we'd like something that 
> looks a bit more professional.

M:
> I can do HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX. Do you want to keep the same sort of 
> style or something completely different?

C:
> We have a list of pages we want but we want it to be a bit more secure, so
> we'd want an open welcome page but require a log in to access any other part
> of the site and a decent forum page. http://worldoftanks.eu/ that's the game
> to give you an idea of style. Can you do logo design?

M:
> You could use phpbb3 for the forum, do you want the login just for the
> forum, or other things as well? I'll be happy to help design the site and
> set up the forum if you want?

C:
> Yeah, I'm out at the moment so can't give proper details, what sort of
> information will you need?

C:
> Home. So I have no knowledge of web design what so ever, so the phpbb3 thing
> means nothing to me, so whatever you think is best or easiest is fine. If i 
> were to draw basic layouts (i mean really crude drawings this really isn't
> my strong point) and what not would you be able to follow that?
>
> What we'd want is for the main page to be accessible to all but the rest of
> the website a log in requirement. Certain things we'd want to be able to
> change, like the main banner, because we have yet to get a logo designed,
> and the ability to add new pages. I don't know how feasible any of this is.

M:
> phpbb3 ( https://www.phpbb.com/ ) is a prebuild open source forum package
> that is really easy to set up, it's what most forums use. Linking the forum
> login with the rest of the site's login might be a problem, but you could
> restrict access to the forums to users logged in on the rest of the site, so
> you would have to create a seperate account for the forum.
>
> If you give me layouts and some color scheame ideas that would be fine to 
> get me started, then we can go from there. Changing parts and adding pages
> shouldn't be a problem.

C:
> Ok, sounds good. I like a black and orange design of sorts, anything tanky
> if that makes sense, just not that standard camo look. Can you do any logo
> designs or is it just web design? I will discuss the layout but I'm thinking
> something along these lines http://i.imgur.com/VM5Jggj.png?1 , again
> apologies for the crudeness of this, we do have a photos section but its
> just a page of photos, is it possible to have like a player of sorts?

M:
> I'm not that strong on logos, you'd probably be better off going to someone
> else for that, the layout looks good. The photos page should be fine, by
> player, do you mean a player account page?

C:
> something like what msn has http://uk.msn.com/, so it has that thing at the
> top the "player" to select stories, but something similar for photos.
> http://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/slideshow/#screenshot/579763
> thats the closest thing I could find to what I mean.
>
> I'm also thinking of having a rusty texture for the background.

M:
> Oh, player as in gallery? Sorry, I thought you ment a player like a player
> in a game. Yes I could do something like that easily :)

C:
> yes a gallery, the word escaped me. I will let you know if there's anything
> specific that we want anywhere or if there is anything you can think of that
> you think would look neat or be good, then please let us know.

M:
> OK, I'll start working on a layout and some basic styling tonight then :)

M:
> So I've got most of the layout done:
> http://dvbris.no-ip.org/webDesign/MrDorph How do you like this so far? I
> havn't done any text styling yet, but the layout is there, and its fairly
> responsive. Do you have any suggestions, things I've done wrong? What were
> you planning on putting in the sidebar, adds or more information? I was
> thinking we could put the login form in there if you had no other plans. The
> background gives it a sort of rust look, I found this collection:
> http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/handy-roundup-of-free-seamless-repeating-textures
> are there any you think would work better / want me to try?

C:
> It looks great, We'll be tweaking what goes on that home page, none of the
> links work is that right? other than that i've put it out to a few of the
> other members and i'll let you know. Can you get rid of the side bar? what I
> would want is either side of the center section is a long picture, if you
> get what i mean, like the one on the world of tanks website (
> worldoftanks.eu )
>
> Other than that I like the background you selected, Hopefully we'll be able
> to sort out a proper EAB heading. Could you make the Links at the top a
> solid colour? Orange with black writing and could you make them rounder?

M:
> Cool :) Correct, the links are dud. I just copied the old text so I could
> have somethink to work on.
>
> Ok, I understand what you mean about the side bar, that can be done and I'll
> sort out the links. Do you have any ideas about fonts?
> ( http://google.com/fonts ) is a good place to find free ones. What do you
> want in the header at the top of the page? A banner image with your logo, or
> heading?

C:
> I'll discuss the phont with the team, hopefully we'll have a proper logo
> sorted soon to put at the top. I'll also have a look for a picture to put
> wither side. Where it say copyright at the bottom, feel free to put designed
> by and then your information.

M:
> Ok, updated with temp stolen worldoftanks background image, is that what you
> were after? Also updated links, what do you think of the orange color, do
> you want me to change the shade?

C:
> That looks great, really like it, I'll try and get the font sorted out with
> someone and a proper welcome message for you to put on the home page, but so
> far I'm really impressed. Thanks

M:
> Awesome :) Glad you like it.
>
> I'm going away without proper internet for the next few days, I'll be back
> on tuesday, so we'll start sorting out the forum and stuff then.

C:
> I've been asked to ask you about the possibility of adding advertising for
> help for heroes and the royal British legion to all the pages, somewhere in
> the footer, they're UK charities for troops, do you know if there's a
> protocol to it?

M:
> I don't know if there are any protocols, but I imagine you could just link
> to their donate page in the footer. You might what to contact them to ask
> them if they have any particular way of doing it.

C:
> I will leave it until its closer to being finished, there were a few other
> things I was asked to mention but I will leave it for now, time for bed.

C:
> Hey, any update on the website?

M:
> Do you have any plans for hosting/domain name, if you are planning using a
> free host I recommend 000webhost.com I have used them multiple times and
> they are good for a free host. If you are using another host, make sure they
> have php installed as we will need that for phpbb3.
>
> Also do you have any update on the logo or background image?

C:
> Hello. We will be in purchasing a .co.uk domain, I think it will be
> WWW.englisharmouredbrigade.co.UK, not too sure or EAB.co.UK, something along
> those lines. Do you know how we would go about putting the website up? We
> would like to keep the background image as is, would there be any copyright
> problems with this? I will link you the logo when I finish it, we're just
> using a basic logo designer so it wont be to fancy.

M:
> To put the website up you will need a host, you can usually get free hosting
> when you purchice a domain name, just make sure you find one with php and
> mysql, ask me if you need help finding one.
>
> There would definatly be problems with using the world of tanks image, as it
> is theirs. We could try to find a similar image but copyright free, you
> could also try taking an ingame screenshot, I don't mind doing some light
> editing to put some screenshots together.
>
> Do you have any update on the font?

C:
> Hello, I have messaged wargaming regarding the use of their images and
> hopefully they will get back to me soon. Would the host you recommended be
> suitable for all the stuff we will need? I will let you pick the font, there
> are far too many, Something bold and easy to read.
>
> Update to the layout Ideas, for the tabs at the top we would like home to
> become welcome, photos to become gallery, downloads and contacts to be moved
> to the end, with contacts right at the end, and info to become announcements
> or news what ever looks better.
>
> so it will be, Welcome, about, news, gallery, forum, downloads, contact.
>
> How do we go about setting up admins once the site is finished? With the
> gallery will we be able to set one up for videos? Embedding the youtube
> player or something like that? I am working till 11 tonight so won't be bale
> to get back to you till then, hopefully I will have been sent the welcome
> page message by then and will be able to send it to you.

M:
> You could use any site to buy the domain, this is a good one:
>
> http://123reg.co.uk
>
> For hosting, this is a free uk host which does everything you need:
>
> http://www.getfreehosting.co.uk
>
> I've edited the navigation bar.
>
> For the admins, I'll create a basic admin page for editing the pages with a
> password to get in (so to add a admin, you just give them the password), but
> you can always come back and ask me if you want anything done.
>
> The gallery can do youtube, videos, anything... even other websites if you
> really want!

C:
> It will be just to update the images and news section, and to upload images
> and videos as well. What do you mean by other websites? This threw me a bit.
>
> Out of interest do you game at all?

M:
> That should all work.
>
> I just meant you could have a frame where another website could be displayed
> like an image. You probably wont need to use this though.
>
> No I don't really game, I used to a bit, but It meant I ran out of time for
> other things.

C:
> This looks pretty much like what I have now, but yep, that is, though
> unfinished, looking fine.

M:
> Opps, didnt update the online version, navigation should be right now.

C:
> hello, bit of an update for you, still no logo i'm afraid but soon
> hopefully.
>
> We would like the welcome page message to be this:-
>
> "This website is for EAB members to keep up with scheduled events, post
> comments to other clan members and generally gain as much information as you
> can.
>
> EAB is English speaking and over 16's only!
>
> the english armoured brigade is a clan, of which members are associated with
> world of tanks. We are a community of players who share a common love of pc
> games and tanks. we strive to gain success in matches and to make our named
> noticed among the world of tanks community."
>
> With a link at the bottom, like a button thing, saying new recruits which
> will the redirect them to a sign up page to create a log in and what not.
>
> Change the about page to Info and then to read this :-
>
> "TEAMSPEAK Firstly, our Teamspeak server has been created for the use of EAB
> members, its for our clan to use for the use of improving platoon games and
> for us all to gather in the lobby and talk about WOT and to get to know each
> other. Those who shy away from teamspeak and dont get involved will have no
> future. Teamspeak will be our key to tactics on the battlefield in clan
> matches and clan wars, so please lets all get to know each other and use it
> to our advantage when going out in platoon games and training! Talking to
> each other is also key to learning from one another and discussing tanks and
> tech tree routes, We all have different knowledge of tanks and tech tree
> routes so lets share them.
>
> BATTLE TACTICS AND STRUCTURE Just let me explain our structure in our
> proposed clan battles (tank companies), Having discussed this with our Field
> commanders we have come up with a basic battle proposal. Every match will
> consist of platoons. Every platoon will have a field commander made up with
> a soldier and/or recruit. The field commander of every platoon will take
> responsability of each platoon and make immediate decisions, however at the
> beginning of every match every platoon will be assigned a general order and
> task, this order will be issued by the acting commander in charge of that
> match! All communication on teamspeak will take place between the acting
> Commander and Field commanders to keep communication clearer and to a
> minimum.
>
> EARLY BATTLES In these early stages of tank companies we have found that
> only a certain number of tanks win matches on a regular basis. Firstly, the
> only tier 6 heavy which dominates the match is the KV1S. The only tank which
> is a valuable support tank is the Hellcat, and The fastest tier 4 scout is
> the T50. Tier4 artillery is whichever a player wishes to use. These tanks
> are the best line-up for winning tank companies, and we will have to apply a
> system to suite when we go up to the next tank company level. So please can
> all players keep those tanks in their garage for assisting the team in Tank
> companies.
>
> TANKS So from what you can see you can get a good idea of what tanks you may
> need to be looking at as we progress, however we do understand that others
> will want to play with tank destroyers and light tanks here and there in
> Platoon games, this is fine, at the end of the day nobody can stop you
> heading for tanks for your own personal agenda, Platoon games are for fun
> and to get used to playing with each other.
>
> TRAINING Before we organise a tank company battle, we will be heading into 
> the training room for a quick recap on the system and get used to gathering
> into our correct platoons, and also for receiving orders etc. Also training
> matches will be organised everfy now and again to improve our game play
>
> CLAN WARS! A quick section about clan wars. We should consider entering clan
> wars when we have at least 20 members (but more will be ideal) who have tier
> 8 and above tanks (tier9 and 10 are really essential to winning battles). So
> i would probably estimate that with the regular people we have gaming at the
> moment, and knowing what tanks we have, i would put a date on October to
> Christmas time before we have the men and tanks to attack a province on the
> clan wars map! This might seem a long way away but we have to look at it
> intelligently. Its the numbers of regular players with high tier tanks that
> we need! So those of you with 5's and 6's you need to get cracking if you
> want to be on the front line!
>
> PREMIUM ACCOUNT Just a short note to people who dont have premium account, i
> know its 9 quid a month but if you can manage it every now and again i
> highly recommend it, Its much quicker up the tech tree! But i do understand
> if you cant manage it!
>
> PROMOTIONS Promotions will happen regularly to people who use teamspeak and
> put 100 percent into platoon games. However, to become a field commander you
> must show real skill and leadership in the game, being able to make the
> right decisions for your platoon, and even being able to bark out orders.
> Myself and the other commanders do check how people play and we are
> constantly looking for the players who show these abilities! So if you think
> you can become a field commander, then show us.
>
> INFO Information will posted on this website, either on the forum or in the
> schedule battle section (calander) so please check regularly for updates.
>
> Thanks for reading and if you have any suggestions then please feel free to
> email me or speak to me on Teamspeak, Regards, Rokossovsky."

C:

C:

M:

C:

C:

C:

M:

C:

C:

C:

M:
> Ok. Do you have any websites that sort of match the style you're going for,

C:

M:

M:

M:

### Edge_Sharp - IN PROGRESS
#### http://dvbris.no-ip.org/webDesign/Edge_Sharp/

C:
> olls96, are you offering to help design a website? If so, I would really
> appreciate any assistance you could offer.
>
> Let me know, Thanks,

M:
> Yes, I'll help you, what do you need?

C:
> I really could use any advise or help you would be willing to provide. I am
> in the process of starting up a company that helps small and med sized
> business increase their onsite (at their office) banking security. I have
> designed the system (product) and was just beging to test it with small
> business in my area (about 5), when I happend to discuss my idea with one of
> my local banks. As it turns out, they loved the idea and want me to come in
> and present my product to their director. While I have the product, I dont
> have any online presence of a company yet, so I am trying to get something,
> anything up that makes this look half way legitimate. To give you a little
> background about my self, I am a product developer and sales man by trade,
> but I unfortunately know very little about website design. So with all that
> said, do you think you could help me get something very basic setup? I am
> more than happy to write or provide whatever would be needed (text for
> pages, website requirements, etc...), I just need someone who can tell me/
> show me what to do.
>
> So what do you think?

M:
> I'm happy to help you set something up, what sort of pages were you planning
> on having?

C:
> My initial idea was to keep it as simple as possible, but still have it look
> professional. I was thinking that it would probably follow the standard
> 'Home, Product, Blog, Contact' template/design. If at all possible, it would
> be great to have a section where a potential customer could request more
> info. But I think for now, this is all I would need. What are your thoughts?

M:
> That's all fine. The contact form should be easily doable as well. Do you
> have any idea about the style, or layout of the website, or some example
> websites that sort of match what your after looks-wise?

C:
> Sorry about not getting back to you right away, I have been tied up for a

> designs.
> http://www.aeris.com/ http://www.angleseyonline.com/
> http://www.esourcemarketing.com/ I like the simplicity of their sites, and I
> think it would fit the needs of my service. Since the product is a secure
> banking system, it is not really 'flashy', so I don't believe it will
> warrant a lot of pictures.
