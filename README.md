> www.eab-wot.moonfruit.com This our current website that was thrown together 
> in about 5 minutes. Its a gaming clan website, we'd like something that 
> looks a bit more professional.

M:
> I can do HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX. Do you want to keep the same sort of 
> style or something completely different?

C:
> We have a list of pages we want but we want it to be a bit more secure, so
> we'd want an open welcome page but require a log in to access any other part
> of the site and a decent forum page. http://worldoftanks.eu/ that's the game
> to give you an idea of style. Can you do logo design?

M:
> You could use phpbb3 for the forum, do you want the login just for the
> forum, or other things as well? I'll be happy to help design the site and
> set up the forum if you want?

C:
> Yeah, I'm out at the moment so can't give proper details, what sort of
> information will you need?

C:

> my strong point) and what not would you be able to follow that?

> change, like the main banner, because we have yet to get a logo designed,
> and the ability to add new pages. I don't know how feasible any of this is.

M:
> phpbb3 ( https://www.phpbb.com/ ) is a prebuild open source forum package
> that is really easy to set up, it's what most forums use. Linking the forum
> login with the rest of the site's login might be a problem, but you could
> restrict access to the forums to users logged in on the rest of the site, so
> you would have to create a seperate account for the forum.

> If you give me layouts and some color scheame ideas that would be fine to 
> get me started, then we can go from there. Changing parts and adding pages
> shouldn't be a problem.

C:
> Ok, sounds good. I like a black and orange design of sorts, anything tanky
> if that makes sense, just not that standard camo look. Can you do any logo
> designs or is it just web design? I will discuss the layout but I'm thinking
> something along these lines http://i.imgur.com/VM5Jggj.png?1 , again
> apologies for the crudeness of this, we do have a photos section but its
> just a page of photos, is it possible to have like a player of sorts?

M:
> I'm not that strong on logos, you'd probably be better off going to someone
> else for that, the layout looks good. The photos page should be fine, by
> player, do you mean a player account page?

C:
> something like what msn has http://uk.msn.com/, so it has that thing at the
> top the "player" to select stories, but something similar for photos.
> http://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/slideshow/#screenshot/579763
> thats the closest thing I could find to what I mean.
>
> I'm also thinking of having a rusty texture for the background.

M:
> Oh, player as in gallery? Sorry, I thought you ment a player like a player
> in a game. Yes I could do something like that easily :)

C:
> yes a gallery, the word escaped me. I will let you know if there's anything
> specific that we want anywhere or if there is anything you can think of that
> you think would look neat or be good, then please let us know.

M:
> OK, I'll start working on a layout and some basic styling tonight then :)
