C:
> hey, just inquiring about the webdesign offer you put up, what exactly can 
> you do?
>
> www.eab-wot.moonfruit.com This our current website that was thrown together 
> in about 5 minutes. Its a gaming clan website, we'd like something that 
> looks a bit more professional.

M:
> I can do HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX. Do you want to keep the same sort of 
> style or something completely different?

C:
> We have a list of pages we want but we want it to be a bit more secure, so
> we'd want an open welcome page but require a log in to access any other part
> of the site and a decent forum page. http://worldoftanks.eu/ that's the game
> to give you an idea of style. Can you do logo design?

M:
> You could use phpbb3 for the forum, do you want the login just for the
> forum, or other things as well? I'll be happy to help design the site and
> set up the forum if you want?

C:
> Yeah, I'm out at the moment so can't give proper details, what sort of
> information will you need?

C:
> Home. So I have no knowledge of web design what so ever, so the phpbb3 thing
> means nothing to me, so whatever you think is best or easiest is fine. If i 
> were to draw basic layouts (i mean really crude drawings this really isn't
> my strong point) and what not would you be able to follow that?
>
> What we'd want is for the main page to be accessible to all but the rest of
> the website a log in requirement. Certain things we'd want to be able to
> change, like the main banner, because we have yet to get a logo designed,
> and the ability to add new pages. I don't know how feasible any of this is.

M:
> phpbb3 ( https://www.phpbb.com/ ) is a prebuild open source forum package
> that is really easy to set up, it's what most forums use. Linking the forum
> login with the rest of the site's login might be a problem, but you could
> restrict access to the forums to users logged in on the rest of the site, so
> you would have to create a seperate account for the forum.
>
> If you give me layouts and some color scheame ideas that would be fine to 
> get me started, then we can go from there. Changing parts and adding pages
> shouldn't be a problem.

C:
> Ok, sounds good. I like a black and orange design of sorts, anything tanky
> if that makes sense, just not that standard camo look. Can you do any logo
> designs or is it just web design? I will discuss the layout but I'm thinking
> something along these lines http://i.imgur.com/VM5Jggj.png?1 , again
> apologies for the crudeness of this, we do have a photos section but its
> just a page of photos, is it possible to have like a player of sorts?

M:
> I'm not that strong on logos, you'd probably be better off going to someone
> else for that, the layout looks good. The photos page should be fine, by
> player, do you mean a player account page?

C:
> something like what msn has http://uk.msn.com/, so it has that thing at the
> top the "player" to select stories, but something similar for photos.
> http://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/slideshow/#screenshot/579763
> thats the closest thing I could find to what I mean.
>
> I'm also thinking of having a rusty texture for the background.

M:
> Oh, player as in gallery? Sorry, I thought you ment a player like a player
> in a game. Yes I could do something like that easily :)

C:
> yes a gallery, the word escaped me. I will let you know if there's anything
> specific that we want anywhere or if there is anything you can think of that
> you think would look neat or be good, then please let us know.

M:
> OK, I'll start working on a layout and some basic styling tonight then :)

C:
> I'm looking for a very simple one page site for Lucky Drone Honey Co. We're

>
> I put in a request for a logo a few days and got some great replies. I'd
> like to apply some updates to the logo submitted here but if you'd rather
> not do logo design, I can work on that and we can stick with what I've

>
> I build web applications (Rails) so I could use a photoshop mockup if that's
> easiest for you. Let me know if you're interested. Thanks!

M:
> Hi, Sorry for not replying sooner, I missed your message in my inbox :S
>
> I'm interested. What sort of style do you want? I'm happy to work from a
> photoshop mockup if you like.
>
> I'm not great at logos, you'd be a lot better off getting someone else to
> work on that, I'd just butcher it :)

> Hi Olls96,

> I've built my own website, doing the full stack, but need a designer to

> You can have a look at the site here: autobean.co.uk. We crawl second hand

> 
> I'm looking for a clean, clear, modern design, but haven't really managed to

> 
> Currently i'm using jade templates with angular.js and bootstrap, but am

> If you could with the mobile version (maybe just by using the responsive

> 
> If you can help, please let me know.

> Cheers,

M:
> I'll be happy to help you design the website, I can do responsive stuff if
> you need. Do you want to keep the curent layout, or completly redesign it?

C:
> I don't mind particular either way. If you think you have some interesting
> ideas for a complete re-design, i'm open to them :). If however you want to
> help polish it up (and maybe focus on making it work on the phone), i'm also
> ok with that.
>
> I guess my single provision if you do want to do a complete redesign is that
> it should remain fairly clean, but i'm certainly open to any ideas you have.

M:
> I think the layout is fine, so we can stick with that. I'm fine to get it
> working on the phone, do you want to keep the phone fairly similar to what
> you've got as well?

C:
> I think on the phone, the results page should just show the adds, and if the
> user wants to refine their search, there should be someway of bringing up a
> menu screen where they can add or remove refinements to their search.

C:
> P.S But yes, the results part doesn't need to be too different between the
> mobile and desktop/ipad versions.

M:
> Ok. Do you have any websites that sort of match the style you're going for,
> so I don't get completly the wrong end of the stick? :D

C:
> Indeed.co.uk is what I was trying to go for... I like their colour scheme,
> and relatively clean professional look
>
> Otherwise websites in the same field tend to have horrible background
> colours. I'm trying to keep it clean/minimal with a white background, but as
> I said, i'm open to expert advice :)
>
> Some sites i'm crawling, which i'm trying to avoid looking like: 
> gumtree.co.uk (horrible background colour) carsite.co.uk (better than
> gumtree, but I guess I hate the green) autotrader.co.uk (not too bad)

M:
> Ok, I'll have a play around with what you've got and see what I can do :)

C:
> No worries. Cheers!

C:
> Greetings olls96,

M:
> Hello, I'll be happy to help you with your website design and any back-end

>Let me know, Thanks,

M:
> Yes, I'll help you, what do you need?

C:
> I really could use any advise or help you would be willing to provide. I am

> designed the system (product) and was just beging to test it with small

>
> So what do you think?

M:
> I'm happy to help you set something up, what sort of pages were you planning

C:
> My initial idea was to keep it as simple as possible, but still have it look

> 'Home, Product, Blog, Contact' template/design. If at all possible, it would
> be great to have a section where a potential customer could request more
> info. But I think for now, this is all I would need. What are your thoughts?

M:
> That's all fine. The contact form should be easily doable as well. Do you
> have any idea about the style, or layout of the website, or some example
> websites that sort of match what your after looks-wise?
